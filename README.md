# Data Science Projects

This repository contains all of my Data Science projects. The projects are organized by topic, and each project has a README file that provides an overview of the project, the dataset, the methodology, and the results.

The projects in this repository cover a variety of topics, including:


* Data Cleaning and Processing
* SQL Database Querying
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Time series analysis
* Linear Regression Analysis
* Data visualization
* Data mining
* Classification with Logistic Regression
